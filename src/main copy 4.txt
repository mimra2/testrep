# Git Operations Learning Guide

## Basic Commands
- **git init**: Initialize a new Git repository.
- **git clone [url]**: Clone an existing repository from a remote source.
- **git add [file]**: Stage changes to a file for the next commit.
- **git commit -m "[message]"**: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- **git status**: Check the status of your working directory and staging area.
- **git push [origin] [branch]**: Push your commits to a remote repository.
- **git pull [origin] [branch]**: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.

## Branching
- **git branch**: List all branches in the repository.
- **git branch [branch-name]**: Create a new branch.
- **git checkout [branch-name]**: Switch to a different branch.
- **git merge [branch-name]**: Merge changes from one branch into the current branch.

## Best Practices
- Commit often with clear, concise messages.
- Use branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Regularly pull changes from the remote repository to stay updated.
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude files that should not be tracked (e.g., logs, build artifacts).
